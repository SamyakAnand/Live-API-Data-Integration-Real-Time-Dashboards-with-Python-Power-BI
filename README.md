# Live API Data Integration: Real-Time Dashboards with Python & Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **live, interactive dashboard** that displays important global statistics such as health, education, employment, and other key indicators.  

- **Data Source**: Public API regularly updated with the latest information  
- **Data Processing**: Python script automatically fetches and processes data for analysis  
- **Integration**: Python script connected directly to Power BI for live data connection  
- **Outcome**: Power BI dashboard refreshes automatically whenever new data is available, eliminating manual updates  

The dashboard provides **easy-to-understand visuals** (charts, graphs, trend lines) to help users explore patterns across countries and regions.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Fetch Data**: Python script retrieves fresh data from the API.  
2. **Process Data**: Clean and prepare data for analysis.  
3. **Connect to Power BI**: Establish live connection for real-time updates.  
4. **Visualize**: Build interactive dashboards with charts, graphs, and trend analysis.

## 🎯 Key Questions Addressed

### 1. Understand the Overall Economic & Social Landscape
- Average **GDP per capita** → measure of individual economic well-being  
- Average **trade value** → activity in international markets  
- Average **health spending (% of GDP)** → national health investment priorities  
- Average **GDP growth rate** → overall economic momentum  
- **Forest area proportion** → impact on land use, agriculture, and natural resources  

These metrics provide foundational context before deeper analysis.

---

### 2. Compare Health Spending Patterns Across Regions
- Compare **average health spending (% of GDP)** across world regions  
- Highlight **regional disparities** and differences in health outcomes or priorities  

---

### 3. Analyze Trends in Key Socio-Economic Indicators
Track changes over time in:  
- Forest area  
- Mobile subscriptions  
- Internet subscriptions  
- GDP  
- Renewable energy use  
- Unemployment  

These trends reveal whether countries are moving in positive or negative directions.

---

### 4. Evaluate Impact of Internet Access on Immunization Awareness
- Assess relationship between **internet penetration** and **immunization rates**  
- Explore how digital connectivity improves **health information access** and **public engagement**  

---

### 5. Assess Role of Internet Access in Reducing Unemployment
- Investigate whether expanding **internet penetration** contributes to lowering unemployment levels  

---

### 6. Identify Underperforming Countries in Poverty Reduction
- Pinpoint **bottom 10 countries** with least progress in reducing poverty  
- Guide policymakers, NGOs, and donors to focus resources on struggling nations  

---

### 7. Identify Top-Performing Countries in Poverty Reduction
- Highlight **top 10 countries** with most progress in reducing poverty  
- Extract lessons from successful policies and strategies  

---

### 8. Examine Interrelationships Among Health Indicators
- Explore correlations between:  
  - Health expenditure  
  - Life expectancy  
  - Immunization rates  
  - Child mortality  
  - Disease burden  

Understanding these relationships helps shape **integrated health strategies**.

---

### 9. Investigate Relationship Between Government Health Spending & Life Expectancy
- Use **trend line analysis** to explore whether increased health expenditure improves life expectancy  
- Determine if spending alone is effective or if other factors must be addressed  

---

## 🚀 Outcomes
- Real-time, automated dashboards  
- Actionable insights for policymakers, NGOs, and researchers  
- Evidence-based strategies for improving health, education, and poverty reduction
